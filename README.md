## About ##

This simple solution was put together for displaying how the above features are utilised even for a very minimalistic application that allows for extensibility, testability and maintanibility. To get something up and running, the example was extended on top of the [football stats project v1](https://github.com/dejanvasic85/FootballStats).

## Running the Console ##

Open the solution, set the Football project to start-up and run! You will get the help menu with some available commands. You can always see this by supplying "help" "?" or "h".

To close the application enter "quit", "q" or "exit".
